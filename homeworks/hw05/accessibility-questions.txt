Please answer the following accessibility questions:


1. What accessibility corrections did you have to make?


2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
No, because the directions on how to use the site are not clear without the CSS. The styling signifiers help people understand what is a button, link, etc. 

3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?
Yes, all links and buttons are tabbable (usable/accessible without a mouse).
