What corrections did you have to make, and how did you make them? : There were only 2 errors. The first was just specifying the language in the html to be english. The second just required to add a label element to the search bar. 
Is this interface functional without the use of a mouse (i.e., just using keyboard keys)? Why or why not? It is relatively usable without a mouse, however, tabbing never gets you to the tracks in order to play them. You can search for artists and tracks without needing the mouse, however. 
What are other accessibility tests or features you added or would be interested in learning about? I did not add any additional accessibility features, but it would be interesting and helpful to add a way to allow the tab button to eventually navigate to play the tracks after searching.
